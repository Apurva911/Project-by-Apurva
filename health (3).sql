This hormone allows blood sugar to enter cells.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>In people without diabetes, blood sugar levels remain within a narrow range throughout the day. For those who have diabetes, however, this system doesn&rsquo;t work in the same way.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>This is a big problem, because having both too high and too low blood sugar levels can cause severe harm.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>There are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/types-of-diabetes\" target=\"_blank\">several types</a>&nbsp;of diabetes, but the two most common ones are type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Both of these conditions can occur at any age.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>In type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune process destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. People with diabetes take insulin several times a day to ensure that glucose gets into the cells and stays at a healthy level in the bloodstream (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1489998/\" target=\"_blank\">4Trusted Source</a>).</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>In type 2 diabetes, the beta cells at first produce enough insulin, but the body&rsquo;s cells are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/insulin-and-insulin-resistance/\">resistant</a>&nbsp;to its action, so blood sugar remains high. To compensate, the pancreas produces more insulin, attempting to bring blood sugar down.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Over time, the beta cells lose their ability to produce enough insulin (<a href=\"http://www.nutricionhospitalaria.com/pdf/6717.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">5</a>).</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Of the three macronutrients &mdash;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-per-day/\">protein</a>, carbs, and fat &mdash; carbs have the greatest impact on blood sugar management.

Bernstein, who has type 1 diabetes, has eaten 30 grams of carbs per day and documented excellent blood sugar management in his patients who follow the same regimen (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18370654\" target=\"_blank\">15Trusted Source</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, other research shows that more moderate carb restriction, such as 70&ndash;90 grams of total carbs, or 20% of calories from carbs, is also effective (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2424054/\" target=\"_blank\">13Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16454166\" target=\"_blank\">16Trusted Source</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The optimal amount of carbs may also vary by individual, since everyone has a unique response to carbs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all diet that works for everyone with diabetes. Personalized meal plans, which take into account your dietary preferences and metabolic goals, are best (<a href=\"http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/42/Supplement_1/S46\" target=\"_blank\">17</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ADA also recommends that individuals work with their healthcare team to determine the carb intake that&rsquo;s right for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To figure out your ideal amount of carbs, you may want to measure your blood glucose with a meter before a meal and again 1 to 2 hours after eating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as your blood sugar remains below 140 mg/dL (8 mmol/L), the point at which damage to nerves can occur, you can consume 6 grams, 10 grams, or 25 grams of carbs per meal on a low carb diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It all depends on your personal tolerance. Just remember that the general rule is the less carbs you eat, the less your blood sugar will rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, rather than eliminating all carbs, a healthy low carb diet should actually include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-most-nutrient-dense-foods-on-the-planet/\">nutrient-dense</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/22-high-fiber-foods/\">high fiber</a>&nbsp;carb sources, like vegetables, berries, nuts, and seeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><strong>SUMMARY</strong>\r\n\r\n<p>Carb intake between 20&ndash;90 grams per day has been shown to be effective at improving blood sugar management in people with diabetes. However, it&rsquo;s best to test blood sugar before and after eating to find your personal carb limit.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"Which-carbs-raise-blood-sugar-levels?\">Which carbs raise blood sugar levels?</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In plant foods, carbs comprise a combination of starch, sugar, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/fiber-can-help-with-t2d-and-heart-disease\">fiber</a>. Only the starch and sugar components raise blood sugar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiber that&rsquo;s naturally found in foods, whether soluble or insoluble, doesn&rsquo;t break down into glucose in the body, and doesn&rsquo;t raise blood sugar levels (<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fiber/art-20043983\" target=\"_blank\">18</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can actually subtract the fiber and sugar alcohols from the total carb content, leaving you with the digestible or &ldquo;net&rdquo; carb content. For example, 1 cup of cauliflower contains 5 grams of carbs, 3 of which are fiber. Therefore, its net carb content is 2 grams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prebiotic fiber, such as inulin, has even been shown to improve fasting blood sugar and other health markers in people with type 2 diabetes (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3963683/\" target=\"_blank\">19Trusted Source</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/sugar-alcohols-good-or-bad/\">Sugar alcohols</a>, such as maltitol,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/xylitol-101/\">xylitol</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/erythritol/\">erythritol</a>, and sorbitol, are often used to sweeten sugar-free candy and other &ldquo;diet&rdquo; products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of them, especially maltitol, can actually raise blood sugar levels in people with diabetes (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087388\" target=\"_blank\">20Trusted Source</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this reason, use the net carb tool cautiously, as the count listed on a product&rsquo;s label may not be accurate if all the carbs contributed by maltitol are subtracted from the total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the net carb tool isn&rsquo;t used by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the ADA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This&nbsp;<a href=\"http://denversdietdoctor.com/atkinscarbcounter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">carb counter</a>&nbsp;may be a valuable resource.

In this case, the pancreas doesn&rsquo;t make insulin, and sugar is removed from the body during urination.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Being overweight or obese increases a person&rsquo;s risk for developing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes\">type 2 diabetes</a>. People with type 2 diabetes have a condition called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/insulin-resistance-symptoms\">insulin resistance</a>. This means that the pancreas can typically still make insulin, but the body can&rsquo;t use it properly. The pancreas tries to compensate by making more insulin, but it eventually wears out.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Weight loss, which can be achieved through diet changes, exercise, and certain medications, can be an important way to help combat insulin resistance and treat type 2 diabetes, and in some instances type 1.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong><a name=\"unexpected-weight-loss\">How can diabetes cause weight loss?</a></strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Unexpected or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/unexplained-weight-loss\">unintended weight loss</a>&nbsp;is often a symptom of unmanaged diabetes, both type 1 and type 2.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>With type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks cells of the pancreas that make insulin. Since there&rsquo;s no insulin available to move glucose into the body&rsquo;s cells, glucose builds up in the bloodstream. The kidneys then work to remove this unused sugar through urination. The sugar isn&rsquo;t used as energy, so the body starts burning fat and muscle for energy, resulting in weight loss.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Weight loss in type 1 diabetes may be unintentional.

For best results, dry canned chickpeas as much as possible, then place them on a baking sheet in a single layer in the freezer. Once frozen, store them in a zip-top bag or other airtight container.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Health benefits</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite their humble appearance, chickpeas are a veritable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/chickpeas-nutrition-benefits\">powerhouse of nutrition</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/173799/nutrients\" target=\"_blank\">One cupTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;of the cooked beans contains 12.5 grams of fiber, 14.5 grams of protein, and just 4 grams of fat.

Simply add a whole grain (like rice, quinoa, or pasta) and a vegetable (broccoli, green beans, or carrots, perhaps?) and dinner is well on its way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a flavor boost, sprinkle pantry staple herbs and spices like dried basil, rosemary, oregano, or garlic powder on your chicken before cooking.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Save it for later</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pardon us while we do a little chicken dance for chicken. It&rsquo;s just that this meat is so simple to preserve for supplying healthy meals down the road. Raw chicken breast can be frozen in its original packaging (but will be easier to remove individually if you separate breasts into their own foil packets).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cooked chicken is also extremely easy to freeze. Just place it in an airtight container in the freezer for<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-long-does-chicken-last-in-the-fridge\">&nbsp;up to 9 months</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Health benefits</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The high-quality complete protein in this poultry choice can support your immune system, help you build muscle, and promote wound healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"salmon\">Smoked salmon</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prep suggestions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Fresh salmon filets get plenty of homage for their versatility and healthy fats, but smoked salmon is an even easier route to healthy meals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because it&rsquo;s already cooked, it arrives ready for insertion into wraps (try a salmon-kale combo), salads, and pastas. Smoked salmon pairs especially well with the flavors of lemon, dill, smoky paprika, or cream cheese.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Save it for later</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since smoked salmon typically comes in smaller packages, you may not have leftovers to save. If you do, though, you can keep it in a sealed container in the fridge for 1 week (or 1 month in the freezer).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Health benefits</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like fresh salmon, smoked salmon contains plenty of omega-3 fatty acids, known for their benefits for heart and brain health. It&rsquo;s also got vitamins A and E, antioxidants that work to combat inflammation. Just beware its high<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/smoked-salmon-calories#nutrients\">&nbsp;sodium content</a>&nbsp;of 600-1,200 milligrams per 100-gram serving.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"tofu\">Extra-firm tofu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prep suggestions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re still on the fence about tofu, it&rsquo;s possible you just haven&rsquo;t tried it prepared well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pressing the liquid out of extra-firm tofu gets it ready for delightfully crispy pan-frying, making it the perfect protein for stir fries, curries, and Asian noodle dishes. Its neutral flavor allows it to take on the essence of whatever sauce or seasoning you apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Save it for later</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Got leftovers after your pad Thai? Extra-firm tofu should be kept in the refrigerator in sealed packaging 5-7 days or the freezer for 4-6 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Health benefits</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t fear the &rsquo;fu! Though still dogged by myths that it&rsquo;ll alter your hormones,<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6946133/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;researchTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;shows that tofu is actually potentially beneficial for preventing hormone-related cancers like breast cancer. Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s got plenty of plant-based protein (<a href=\"https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/172475/nutrients\" target=\"_blank\">17 gramsTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;per 3.5-ounce serving) and over 50% of the Daily Value of calcium.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"lentils\">Red lentils</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prep suggestions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of cooking time, red lentils are fairly middle-of-the-road, with typical simmering times around 20-25 minutes. And though you could choose any of several lentil colors (including green, yellow, brown, and black), the red variety has an earthy flavor that&rsquo;s mild and slightly sweet &mdash; just right for daal, an Indian stew featuring tomatoes, onions, and spices. (Try<a href=\"https://www.platejoy.com/recipe/3255/5?correlationId=f05511b6-e9aa-4085-a08f-2367426ba42f\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;this gingery recipe</a>!)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Save it for later</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cooked lentils can be a companion to next-day saut&eacute;ed greens or serve as a high-fiber topping for baked sweet potatoes. Or simply refrigerate them in a sealed container for 5-7 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Health benefits</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a member of the pulse family, lentils have health benefits galore. Their mix of fiber and antioxidants make them a friend to heart health, and they&rsquo;re surprisingly high in protein at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/174284/nutrients\" target=\"_blank\">46 grams per cupTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;(dried).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"spaghetti\">Whole wheat spaghetti</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prep suggestions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For a last-minute dinner fix, there&rsquo;s nothing like a box of pasta. And if you make it a box of whole wheat spaghetti, you&rsquo;ll get sturdy, thin (but not too thin) noodles that go with just about everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use whole wheat spaghetti as the base of a Mediterranean-inspired pasta featuring sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes, and olives. Or let it soak up a jarred or homemade pesto, plus cannellini beans and fresh arugula.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Save it for later</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Extra uncooked whole wheat spaghetti needs no special storage instructions, but the cooked kind needs to be refrigerated. (You can keep it there for 3-5 days.) Cooked pasta can also be frozen, but might come out mushy when reheated.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Health benefits</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Whole wheat spaghetti has a sizable dose of fiber, which helps regulate digestion, may promote healthy weight maintenance, and can help reduce cholesterol.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n', 'ff.jpg', 6, 5, '2024-02-29 09:18:44'),

Keep the fuss to a minimum and stick with the basics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Lunges</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Challenging your balance is an essential part of a well-rounded exercise routine. Lunges do just that, promoting functional movement while also increasing strength in your legs and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/exercise-fitness/how-to-stretch-glutes\">glutes</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Basic Lunges\" src=\"https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lunges.gif\" />Share on Pinterest</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms down at your sides.</li>\r\n	<li>Take a step forward with your right leg and bend your right knee as you do so, stopping when your thigh is parallel to the ground. Ensure that your right knee doesn&rsquo;t extend past your right foot.</li>\r\n	<li>Push up off your right foot and return to the starting position. Repeat with your left leg. This is one rep.</li>\r\n	<li>Complete 3 sets of 10 reps.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Pushups</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Drop and give me 20!&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/muscles-worked-push-ups\">Pushups</a>&nbsp;are one of the most basic yet effective bodyweight moves you can perform because of the number of muscles that are recruited to perform them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share on Pinterest</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Start in a plank position.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-engage-your-core\">Your core should be tight</a>, shoulders pulled down and back, and your neck neutral.</li>\r\n	<li>Bend your elbows and begin to lower your body down to the floor. When your chest grazes it, extend your elbows and return to the start. Focus on keeping your elbows close to your body during the movement.</li>\r\n	<li>Complete 3 sets of as many reps as possible.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can&rsquo;t quite perform a standard pushup with good form, drop down to a modified stance on your knees &mdash; you&rsquo;ll still reap many of the benefits from this exercise while building strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Squats</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Squats increase lower body and core strength, as well as flexibility in your lower back and hips. Because they engage some of the largest muscles in the body, they also pack a major punch in terms of calories burned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share on Pinterest</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Start by standing straight, with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and your arms at your sides.</li>\r\n	<li>Brace your core and, keeping your chest and chin up, push your hips back and bend your knees as if you&rsquo;re going to sit in a chair.</li>\r\n	<li>Ensuring your knees don&rsquo;t bow inward or outward, drop down until your thighs are parallel to the ground, bringing your arms out in front of you in a comfortable position. Pause for 1 second, then extend your legs and return to the starting position.</li>\r\n	<li>Complete 3 sets of 20 reps.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Standing overhead dumbbell presses</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Compound exercises, which utilize multiple joints and muscles, are perfect for busy bees as they work several parts of your body at once. A standing overhead press isn&rsquo;t only one of the best exercises you can do for your shoulders, but it also engages your upper back and core.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share on Pinterest</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Equipment:</strong>&nbsp;10-pound dumbbells</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Pick a light set of dumbbells &mdash; we recommend 10 pounds to start &mdash; and start by standing, either with your feet shoulder-width apart or staggered. Move the weights overhead so your upper arms are parallel to the floor.</li>\r\n	<li>Bracing your core, begin to push up until your arms are fully extended above your head. Keep your head and neck stationary.</li>\r\n	<li>After a brief pause, bend your elbows and lower the weight back down until your triceps muscle is parallel to the floor again.</li>\r\n	<li>Complete 3 sets of 12 reps.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Dumbbell rows</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only will these make your back look killer in that dress, but dumbbell rows are also another compound exercise that strengthens multiple muscles in your upper body. Choose a moderate-weight dumbbell and ensure that you&rsquo;re squeezing at the top of the movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share on Pinterest</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Equipment:</strong>&nbsp;10-pound dumbbells</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Start with a dumbbell in each hand. We recommend no more than 10 pounds for beginners.</li>\r\n	<li>Bend forward at the waist, so your back is at a 45-degree angle to the ground. Be certain not to arch your back. Let your arms hang straight down. Ensure your neck is in line with your back and your core is engaged.</li>\r\n	<li>Starting with your right arm, bend your elbow and pull the weight straight up toward your chest, making sure to engage your lat and stopping just below your chest.</li>\r\n	<li>Return to the starting position and repeat with the left arm. This is one rep. Repeat 10 times for 3 sets.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Single-leg deadlifts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is another exercise that challenges your balance. Single-leg deadlifts require stability and leg strength. Grab a light to moderate dumbbell to complete this move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share on Pinterest</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Equipment:</strong>&nbsp;dumbbell</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Begin standing with a dumbbell in your right hand, and your knees slightly bent.</li>\r\n	<li>Hinging at the hips, begin to kick your left leg straight back behind you, lowering the dumbbell down toward the ground.</li>\r\n	<li>When you reach a comfortable height with your left leg, slowly return to the starting position in a controlled motion, squeezing your right glute. Ensure that your pelvis stays square to the ground during the movement.</li>\r\n	<li>Repeat 10 to 12 reps before moving the weight to your left hand and repeating the same steps on the left leg. It&rsquo;s suggested to do 3 sets of 10-12 reps per side.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Burpees</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An exercise we love to hate,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/dreaded-exercises-and-why-they-are-good-for-you\">burpees</a>&nbsp;are a super-effective, whole-body move that provides great bang for your buck for cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share on Pinterest</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Start by standing upright with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms down at your sides.</li>\r\n	<li>With your hands out in front of you, start to squat down. When your hands reach the ground, pop your legs straight back into a pushup position.</li>\r\n	<li>Jump your feet up to your palms by hinging at the waist. Get your feet as close to your hands as you can get, landing them outside your hands if necessary.</li>\r\n	<li>Stand up straight, bringing your arms above your head, and jump.</li>\r\n	<li>This is one rep. Complete 3 sets of 10 reps as a beginner.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Side planks</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A healthy body requires a strong core at its foundation, so don&rsquo;t neglect core-specific moves like the side plank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus on the mind-muscle connection and controlled movements to ensure you&rsquo;re completing this move effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share on Pinterest</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Lie on your right side with your left leg and foot stacked on top of your right leg and foot. Prop your upper body up by placing your right forearm on the ground and elbow directly under your shoulder.</li>\r\n	<li>Contract your core to stiffen your spine and lift your hips and knees off the ground, forming a straight line with your body.</li>\r\n	<li>Return to start in a controlled manner. Repeat 3 sets of 10&ndash;15 reps on one side, then switch.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. Planks</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Planks are an effective way to target both your abdominal muscles and your whole body. Planking stabilizes your core without straining your back the way situps or crunches might.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share on Pinterest</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Begin in a pushup position with your hand and toes firmly planted on the ground, your back straight, and your core tight.</li>\r\n	<li>Keep your chin slightly tucked and your gaze just in front of your hands.</li>\r\n	<li>Take deep, controlled breaths while maintaining tension throughout your entire body, so your abs, shoulders, triceps, glutes, and quads are all engaged.</li>\r\n	<li>Complete 2-3 sets of 30-second holds to start.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>10. Glute bridge</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The glute bridge effectively works your entire posterior chain, which isn&rsquo;t only good&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;you, but it&rsquo;ll make your booty look perkier, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share on Pinterest</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Start by lying on the floor with your knees bent, feet flat on the ground, and arms straight at your sides with your palms facing down.</li>\r\n	<li>Pushing through your heels, raise your hips off the ground by squeezing your core, glutes, and hamstrings. Your upper back and shoulders should still be in contact with the ground, and your core down to your knees should form a straight line.</li>\r\n	<li>Pause 1&ndash;2 seconds at the top and return to the starting position.</li>\r\n	<li>Complete 10&ndash;12 reps for 3 sets.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&raquo;MORE:</strong><a href=\"https://www.wellos.com/?utm_source=hl&amp;utm_medium=internal_link\" target=\"_blank\">Learn how to lose weight the healthy way, the Wellos&trade; way</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"how-to-improve\">How to improve workouts</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These fundamental exercises will do your body good, but there&rsquo;s always room to keep pushing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you notice yourself breezing through and barely breaking a sweat, focus on progressive overload by making each move more challenging by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>adding 5 more reps</li>\r\n	<li>adding more weight</li>\r\n	<li>tacking on a jump to moves like squats and lunges</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to switch it up?

For people with these conditions, experts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30130777/\" target=\"_blank\">recommendTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;slightly more acidic skin care products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"signs-of-damage\">How can you tell if your skin barrier is damaged?&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When your skin barrier is not functioning properly, you may be more prone to developing the following skin symptoms and conditions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/dry-skin\">dry, scaly skin</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/itching\">itchiness</a></li>\r\n	<li>rough or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/discolored-skin-patches\">discolored patches</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/skin/acne\">acne</a></li>\r\n	<li>sensitive or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/skin-inflammation\">inflamed areas</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/skin-infection\">bacterial, viral</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/fungal-skin-infection\">fungal skin infections</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"how-to-protect\">How to protect and restore your skin barrier</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the importance of maintaining your skin barrier and acid mantle, what can you do to keep them both healthy and functional? Let&rsquo;s look at five strategies that can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Simplify your skin care routine</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re performing a complicated daily skin regimen involving a basketful of products, you may be inadvertently weakening your skin barrier. Consider talking with a dermatologist or another skin care professional about which products are essential and most effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re exfoliating, notice how your skin reacts to the method you use. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/skin-care-secrets/routine/safely-exfoliate-at-home\" target=\"_blank\">American Academy of Dermatology</a>, those with sensitive skin and darker skin tones may want to use a soft cloth and a mild chemical exfoliant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some types of scrubs and brushes may temporarily damage your skin barrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pay attention to pH</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your skin&rsquo;s delicate acid mantle hovers around a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18489300/\" target=\"_blank\">pH of 4.7Trusted Source</a>. But the pH of some skin products can range from 3.7 to 8.2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers recommend cleansing with a product that has a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30130782/\" target=\"_blank\">pH between 4.0 and 5.0Trusted Source</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping your skin&rsquo;s pH at a healthy level may help protect you from skin conditions like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/dermatitis\">dermatitis</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/ichthyosis-vulgaris\">ichthyosis</a>, acne, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/skin/candida-fungus\"><em>Candida albicans</em></a>&nbsp;infections. Although not all products list their pH, some do.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Try a plant oil to replenish your skin barrier</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5796020/\" target=\"_blank\">Research from 2018Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;suggests that certain plant oils may help repair the skin barrier and also prevent your skin barrier from losing moisture. Many of these oils have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the most effective plant oils to consider using on your skin include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/jojoba-oil-for-face\">jojoba oil</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coconut-oil-and-skin\">coconut oil</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/almond-oil\">almond oil</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/argan-oil-for-skin\">argan oil</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/borage-oil\">borage oil</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/rosehip-oil-benefits\">rosehip oil</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/sunflower-oil-for-skin\">sunflower oil</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/soybean-oil\">soybean oil</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/evening-primrose-oil\">primrose oil</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/health-benefits-black-currant\">black currant oil</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways you can use plant oils on your skin.</p>\r\n', 'SC.jpg', 11, 5, '2024-02-29 09:24:15');
